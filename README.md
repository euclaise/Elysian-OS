# Project Mira: Currently nothing interesting

Currently, this is just me trying to make a microkernel.  Check out the long term part of PLANS.md if you want to have a hint at what I plan this to be.

Instructions for usage:
1. Get a cross compiler
2. Modify build.sh for your cross compiler setup
3. `./build.sh`
4. Either use `bochs` or `qemu-system-i386` to boot it
5. Add something to the code and make a pull request
